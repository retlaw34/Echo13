changes:
  - rscadd: Added "outposts", spaces on the overmap that ships can use to buy cargo
      crates and take on and turn in missions. There is not, at present, any physical
      outpost, though one could be built there by crews that desire to do so.
  - rscadd: Added missions. They must be accepted at outposts, and turned in before
      a time limit passes. Successful completion of a mission will earn the ship credits.
  - tweak: The express cargo console has been changed to the outpost communications
      console.
  - rscadd: The Dwayne, Boyardee, and Kugelblitz ships have had outpost communications
      consoles added to their bridges.
  - tweak: The express cargo consoles (now outpost comms consoles) on the Shetland
      and Skipper have been moved to the bridges of their respective ships.
  - tweak: Ships start with 2000 credits instead of 7500
